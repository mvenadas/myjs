    <h1>Coding Challenge #4 - Building A Tip Calculator</h1>
    <p>
      Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes
      eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill
      value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Your Task</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement üòÖ (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)</li>
        <li>Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: ‚ÄúThe bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25‚Äù</li>
      </ol>
      <strong>Test Data:</strong>
      <br>
      <p>Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430</p>
      <br>
      <strong>Hints:</strong>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2</li>
        <li>Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <code>
      const bill = 275;   
      <br>   
      let tip = bill * 0.15;
      <br><br>
      if (bill >= 50 && bill <= 300) {
        <br>
        console.log(`The bill was $${bill}, the tip was $${tip}, and the total value $${bill + tip}.`);
        <br>
      } else if (bill > 300) {
        <br>
        tip = bill * 0.20;
        <br>
        console.log(`The bill was $${bill}, the tip was $${tip}, and the total value $${bill + tip}.`);
        <br>
      } else {
        <br>
        console.log(`The bill was $${bill} under $50, so the tip was ${tip}, and the total value $${bill + tip}.`);
      }
      <br><br>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> The bill was $25 under $50, so the tip was 3.75, and the total value $28.75.
